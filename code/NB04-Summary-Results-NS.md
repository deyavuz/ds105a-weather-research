## ðŸ“Š<b> NB04 - Summary, Results, and Next Steps </b>

Based on my findings, it is clear that London is not the rainiest city out of all. Although this is not a direct answer to the question <i>"Is London really as rainy as the movies make it out to be?"</i>, as I previously stated, I chose to approach it from a <i>"Is London more rainy than other rainy cities portrayed in movies?"</i> perspective, as it captures the essence and is realistically investigatable with my resources.

So, my answer to both questions is: No, it is not.

-----

Primarily, to recall our <b>  hypotheses</b>:

<b> H0: </b> London's raininess is no different than any other generally-rainy city

<b> H1: </b> London is rainier than the other selected cities

Based on my findings and the plots, it is evident that H0 can be rejected (London's raininess is quite different compared to the other selected cities).

However, H1 was proven to be incorrect, as London was not rainier than the other cities - Kyoto, followed by Seattle, took the lead.

-----

Looking at the data from NB03, Kyoto had the highest frequency of number 1 ranks in raininess, taking the leadership with 283 days, while London only had 171 number 1 ranks, which placed it 4/5 rainiest city based on rain sum between January 2021 and January 2024 (see Fig. 5).

### Limitations and Future Research

The primary limitation while conducting this research were the parameters I could use. As my primary source of data was the OpenMeteo API, I was limited to their data, which covered a set period of time and a pre-decided set of variables (e.g., rain sum, snow sum, etc.). I would have liked to incorporate a longer time period to have a wider range of data, alongside somehow taking rain in movies into consideration in my research, as that was the starting point of the research.

----

Having concluded that no, London is not as rainy as most other rainy, movie-featured cities, a next step in exploratory data analysis would be to consider other variables that could be giving London its rainy reputation.

For this, I am proposing the variable <b> cloud_cover </b> and the hypothesis:

<b> H2: </b> London is not rainy but cloudy, which gives it a rainy reputation

Of course, a direct correlation between cloud cover/cloudiness and London's rainy reputation cannot be proven due to the many, many extraneous factors that go into making a statement like that; however, accompanied by survey or interview responses from Londoners, the relationship could be further clarified. 

----

Additionally, as I have mentioned, using a movie database such as IMDB or TMDB and collecting data through their API could also add an interesting perspective and layer to the research and help us in answering the question "Is London really as rainy as the movies make it out to be?"
